# BandApplicationForm
Simple HTML-CSS-JS form

This is a small project that practices HTML-CSS-JS. 
I was asked from a school to format an application form for the school's band. So here it is.

## Things I've learned
- CSS is a mess (I always knew it, don't know why I thought it would be different this time).
- Checking all validation option with DOM manipulations is also a mess.
- document.querySelector is a hell cooler function that all those 'getElementBy***' functions, I'm inlove.

## Things to improve
- Add email validation.
- Clear the checkboxes when pressing the clear button.

## Questions?
